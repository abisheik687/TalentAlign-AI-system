# TalentAlign AI Requirements Document

## Introduction

TalentAlign AI is an ethical AI recruiting system designed to enhance human decision-making in hiring processes while systematically eliminating historical biases. The system emphasizes transparency, bias mitigation, and candidate dignity throughout the recruitment lifecycle. Built on React/TypeScript frontend, Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB database, and integrated AI services, the platform serves as an augmentation tool for human recruiters rather than a replacement.
